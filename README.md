## üëãüèæ Hi there, I'm Andrew!

Product-driven engineer with a passion for turning ideas into realities. I‚Äôve spent years diving deep into the world of full-stack development, but my heart truly lies in crafting user interfaces that make people smile. I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, intuitive experiences. 

**Seeking a full-time role to join a dynamic team and contribute my skills to innovative projects. Eager to learn and collaborate with talented individuals**.
