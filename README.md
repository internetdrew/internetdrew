## üëãüèæ Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I'm a Software Developer who enjoys turning ideas into solutions that offer great user experiences. I'm proficient across the stack, with a particular focus on crafting intuitive, engaging interfaces. I love focusing on products as a whole, which helps me take ownership of end-to-end processes, making sure that every feature not only works well but also has a positive impact on the business and the user experience.

## Things I've Built
- [My Portfolio](https://github.com/internetdrew/portfolio-v3)
<br> Ah. My little internet baby. I built this with my favorite framework for contentful sites, Astro. It's light, it's fast, it sends as little js to the browser as possible, and I even converted to a markdown-based blog (which from a DX standpoint is **INCREDIBLE** in comparison to dealing with a CMS).

## Things I've Written
As I learn new things, I love to find time to share my lessons to save others time. Here are some of my most recent posts:
