## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I love building digital products and shaping content strategies that help brands communicate with clarity and intent. 

A few years ago, I built a no-code system to help my content marketing team work faster and stay organized across clients, campaigns, and assets. It worked... up to a point. I kept running into the limitations of the tools I was using and realized that if I knew how to build from scratch, I could do a lot more. 

That’s what pushed me to start learning software development. Since then, I’ve been building web apps and looking for an IC role where I can keep growing and building things that actually help people work better.

## 🛠️ Products I've Built

### [TappedIn](https://tappedin-two.vercel.app) (MVP)
An AI-powered tool that helps marketing teams turn blog posts into authority-building LinkedIn posts. Currently gathering feedback from content marketers to guide the next iteration.

### [Where's the Garlic?](https://www.wheresthegarlic.com)
A simple, local-first kitchen inventory app. Know what you have, what you need, and what’s being shopped for, in real time. Currently being transitioned to a business-based solution.
