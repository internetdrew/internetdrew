## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I got into building software because I want to bring people closer together. Funny enough, it feels like social media – for all its ability to connect us to anyone, anywhere – has somehow made us feel more apart. Maybe it’s the overload being knowing of and grappling with too many issues at once.

When I build apps, I try to cut through that noise. I like keeping things simple, focused, and fun – finding ways to keep people connected without adding to the overwhelm. I’m drawn to challenges, whether they’re social or business-related, and I love coming up with solutions that people actually enjoy using.

My background in content strategy (both D2C and B2B) taught me how to really listen – to dig into what people are struggling with and figure out how to solve the actual problem, not just the symptoms. As a developer, I bring that same mindset. I ask questions, poke around at the “why,” and look for the kinds of solutions that make a real difference.
