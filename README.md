## Hi, I'm Andrew!

I build products end-to-end, with a strong bias toward interface craft and user clarity.

Before I was a developer, I spent years leading content marketing for DTC and B2B companies. That work trained me to think obsessively about users: what they’re trying to do, what confuses them, and what actually drives outcomes. That mindset now shapes how I design and build software.

I start with the interface and the user flow, then shape the backend to support it. I care less about abstraction for its own sake and more about whether the product feels obvious, fast, and dependable.

The result is software that’s thoughtfully designed, technically sound, and easy to evolve, built by someone who thinks like a product owner, not just an implementer.
