## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I love building web apps and helping people adopt technical products through easy to follow guides, both written and in video. 

## 🛠️ Things I've Built

### [Just the Count](https://www.justthecount.com/)
A web application built for quick and easy daily counts for local businesses, allowing them to move away from spreadsheets, per-seat pricing, and bloated software. Perfect for daily counts and quick stock checks across multiple locations.

### [TappedIn](https://tappedin-two.vercel.app)
An LLM-powered web app that transforms blog posts into authority-building LinkedIn content. Users paste in a blog, select a tone, define the poster persona and target audience, and generate a tailored post ready for LinkedIn.

### [Where's the Garlic?](https://www.wheresthegarlic.com)
A simple, local-first kitchen inventory app. Know what you have, what you need, and what’s being shopped for, in real time. Currently being transitioned to a business-based solution.
