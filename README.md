## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I started building software to bring people closer together. Ironically, even with social media connecting us to anyone, anywhere, it often feels like we’re more disconnected than ever. These days, the internet experience feels more driven to overwhelm than connect. This is what drives me to create things that are simple, focused on bringing people together, and serve their purpose with minimal noise and distraction.

When I build apps, I try to cut through that noise. I like keeping things simple, focused, and fun – finding ways to keep people connected without adding to the overwhelm. I’m drawn to challenges, whether they’re social or business-related, and I love coming up with solutions that people actually enjoy using.

My background in content strategy (both D2C and B2B) taught me how to really listen – to dig into what people are struggling with and figure out how to solve the actual problem, not just the symptoms. As a developer, I bring that same mindset. I ask questions, poke around at the “why,” and look for the kinds of solutions that make a real difference.
