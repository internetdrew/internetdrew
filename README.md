## Hi, I'm Andrew!

Full-stack engineer. Strong bias toward interface craft, interaction design, and the details that make software feel intentional.
I start with the user experience and work backward to the system. TypeScript, React, Node, but the stack follows the problem.

## Building
- [MenuNook](https://github.com/internetdrew/menu-nook-app) - An interactive menu platform for chef-driven restaurants. Bringing brand content into the dining experience.
- [Absence AI](https://github.com/internetdrew/absence-ai) - A voice agent that automates school absence reporting end-to-end. Zero staff involvement.

## Writing
- [Simplicity Matters](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/simplicity-matters) - Thoughts on wanting calm in an era of accelerating chaos.
- [The Rule That Guides Everything I Build](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/the-rule-that-guides-everything-i-build) - My guiding star for impactful implementations and communications.
