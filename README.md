## Hi, I'm Andrew!

I'm a front-end-focused full-stack product engineer building software that makes people feel calm among the chaos — design-forward, clutter-free, and centered on the experience.

## Things I've Built
- [MenuNook](https://github.com/internetdrew/menu-nook-app) - A menu management platform for pop-up sellers and small businesses to create, share, and instantly update QR-code menus.
- [Absence AI](https://github.com/internetdrew/absence-ai) - A voice-first AI agent that automates school absence reporting. Parents call in, speak naturally, and the system handles everything — collecting student details, triaging illness information for the nurse's office, and generating structured records without any staff involvement.

## Thoughts I've Shared
- [Simplicity Matters](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/simplicity-matters) - Thoughts on wanting calm in an era of accelerating chaos.
- [The Rule That Guides Everything I Build](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/the-rule-that-guides-everything-i-build) - My guiding star for impactful implementations and communications.
