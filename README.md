## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I love working with tight-knit teams who love what they do. Especially pumped about going from 0 to 1, improving user-interfaces and experiences, making technical concepts digestible, and connecting with users to make impactful implementations.

Firm believer in keeping things simple and impactful.

Looking for a role with a tight-knit team to bring a great product and experience to life.
