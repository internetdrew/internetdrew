## Hi, I'm Andrew!

I’m a full-stack developer focused on building simple, thoughtful products. Before writing code, I spent years running content marketing strategy for DTC and B2B businesses, which shapes how I think about users and product today.

## Things I've Built
- [MenuNook](https://www.menunook.com) - A menu management platform for pop-up sellers and small businesses to create, share, and instantly update QR-code menus.

## Thoughts I've Shared
- [Simplicity Matters](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/simplicity-matters) - Thoughts on wanting calm in an era of accelerating chaos.
- [The Rule That Guides Everything I Build](https://www.internetdrew.com/thoughts/the-rule-that-guides-everything-i-build) - My guiding star for impactful implementations and communications.
