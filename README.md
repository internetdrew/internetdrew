## 👋🏾 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

Software Developer turning ideas into impactful solutions with a focus on seamless user experiences. Skilled across the stack, I specialize in creating intuitive, engaging interfaces and take ownership of projects end-to-end to ensure every feature delivers value for both users and the business.

## Things I've Built
- [Lost & Found HQ](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq) (work-in-progress)<br/>Lost & Found HQ is a platform that helps businesses streamline their lost and found operations, making it effortless to reunite customers with their missing items.

- [My Portfolio](https://github.com/internetdrew/portfolio-v3)
<br> I built this with my favorite framework for contentful sites, Astro. It's light, and fast, and sends as little JavaScript to the browser as possible. Leverages a markdown-based blog for simple, easy updates.
