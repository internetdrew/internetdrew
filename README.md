## üëãüèæ Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I love turning ideas into realities on the internet. I‚Äôve spent years diving deep into the world of full-stack development, but my heart truly lies in polishing the fine details of UIs and making experiences so smooth that they make people smile (even on a bad day). I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, intuitive experiences.

**Work Relationship Status:** Currently Looking

I love building things and working with others to bring ideas to life. I'm looking for a role in a startup or small company where I can work closely with smart, driven people, excite users by going hard to implement features on the roadmap and, of course, help drive business growth through impactful implementations.


## Some Things I've Built
- [Hackers, The Unofficial Movie API](https://github.com/internetdrew/hackers-the-api)
<br> An API based on the 1995 movie "Hackers". I built this to get a more intimate feel for building a RESTful API (which I absolutely love doing now) and learn a bit about how to containerize an app (which I'm admittedly still a bit fuzzy on). Get information on characters, organizations, hacks, quotes, and more. Inspired by the continued maintenance of [Cyberdelia NYC](https://www.cyberdelianyc.com/) and [Hackers Curator](https://hackerscurator.com/) by fellow fans. **Hack the planet!**

- [NYC Crash Radar](https://github.com/internetdrew/nyc-crash-radar)
<br> After getting frustrated with learning some back end development and having a tough time getting pumped to code, I built this for fun to remind myself that it's all good. Woosah. This little project leverages New York City's [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data) to see the latest crash data from around New York City.

- [Gather Social](https://github.com/internetdrew/gather-social)
<br> Inspired by a wedding (I tried to build this for the wedding a few days before the wedding [yikes!]), Gather Social allows users to create Instagram-style social feeds for your private events. When the event is over, admins can one-click download all photos submitted for in the event. I realized a fundamental flaw in how I conceptualized this product after fully building it and will be building out a v2 to see if it takes off.

- [My Portfolio](https://github.com/internetdrew/portfolio-v3)
<br> Ah. My little internet baby. I built this with my favorite framework for contentful sites, Astro. It's light, it's fast, it sends as little js to the browser as possible, and I even converted to a markdown-based blog (which from a DX standpoint is **INCREDIBLE** in comparison to dealing with a CMS).

## Things I've Written
