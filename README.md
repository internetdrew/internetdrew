## 👋 Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I'm a product-driven engineer with a passion for turning innovative concepts into exceptional realities. My focus lies in crafting intuitive and user-centric experiences that not only delight users but also contribute significantly to business success. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems through elegant solutions, and I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and create impactful products.

## 👀 My Focus

I'm deeply interested in tapping into user insights to improve their digital experiences. By understanding user behavior, preferences, and pain points, I create solutions that truly resonate with them and exceed their expectations.

## 👨🏾‍💻 Current Tech Stack

I'm enjoying working with Next.js, Supabase, PlanetScale, Prisma, React Hook Form, and more to develop performant and scalable applications. In addition, I'm building up familiarity with NLP and LLMs to better integrate generative AI into products.
