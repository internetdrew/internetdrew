## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Andrew!

I'm a frontend-leaning full-stack software engineer with a passion for creating high-quality internet experiences. I strive to build intuitive and user-centric applications that provide exceptional value to users.

### ðŸ‘€ My Focus

I'm deeply interested in tapping into user insights to improve their digital experiences. By understanding user behavior, preferences, and pain points, I aim to create solutions that truly resonate with them and exceed their expectations.

### ðŸŒ± Current Tech Stack

Currently, I'm enjoying working with Next.js, a versatile React framework, to develop performant and scalable applications. In addition, I'm curious about exploring C# and .NET Maui in the future, as I believe they offer exciting possibilities for cross-platform development.

Let's collaborate and create exceptional digital experiences together!
